# Why am I a Graphic Designer

Being a Graphic Designer is more then a job for me. It's been my goal since I was a little kid.
I'm not in this for the money, even thou it is a nice bonus. As a designer my goal so to make you
and your brand a success, because at the end of the day thats all that matters as the success of you
drives the success of me and any other designer out there.

Deep down I just want to make things, anything from a logo to a box to a 30 minute film. The way that
I'm able to be as creative as I want to be is to focus it threw your brand and your image. You are the
theme that I want to bring to life.
